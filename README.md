# Trip Expense Manager App — Documentation

## 📌 Project Overview

**Trip Expense Manager** is a cross-platform mobile application designed to help groups of friends efficiently manage shared expenses during trips. The app enables real-time collaboration, allowing every member to add, view, and split expenses, with intelligent suggestions and seamless syncing across devices. Each user installs the app on their phone and can join or create trips via a unique code or invite link.

## 🎯 Purpose

To simplify group spending during trips by providing a transparent, real-time, and intelligent expense tracking system that works smoothly across devices and platforms.

## 🧱 Tech Stack

### 📱 Frontend (Mobile App)

* **React Native** — Build cross-platform mobile app (Android + iOS)
* **React Navigation** — Handle page navigation and deep linking
* **Axios / Fetch API** — Communicate with backend APIs
* **AsyncStorage / SecureStore** — Store session tokens and cached data locally
* **Expo Linking** — Handle invite links and trip codes

### ⚙️ Backend (API Server)

* **Node.js + Express.js** — Create REST APIs for trips, expenses, and users
* **Middleware** — JSON parsing, error handling, auth token validation

### 🗃️ Database

* **MongoDB Atlas** — Cloud-hosted NoSQL database to store:

  * Users
  * Trips
  * Expenses
* **Mongoose** — ODM for schema modeling

### ☁️ Hosting & Deployment

* **Render / Railway** — Host the backend server (Express + MongoDB URI)
* **Environment Management** — Use `.env` for API keys, DB URIs, etc.

### 🤖 AI Integration (Optional)

* **OpenAI / Hugging Face APIs** — Use NLP to suggest categories for entered expenses

## 🔐 Security Considerations

* Use **JWT tokens** for user session management
* Use **HTTPS** in production
* Secure trip join codes using UUIDs or cryptographic randomness
* Rate limit API endpoints to prevent abuse

---

## 🧪 Future Enhancements

* Add **Push Notifications** via Expo or Firebase
* Integrate **real-time updates** using Socket.io
* Add **analytics dashboard** for users
* Implement **user authentication** with Firebase Auth or Auth0
